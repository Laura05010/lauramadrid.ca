description: Here I am holding the wooden display board I crafted for my mom's crystal jewelry and crystal tree shop, Alma Happy. I also designed the logo and all of her branding elements, including the website. You can find her mini store at Handmade Heaven in Oakville. Check out her shop on Instagram [@almahappy.ca](https://www.instagram.com/almahappy.ca/).
