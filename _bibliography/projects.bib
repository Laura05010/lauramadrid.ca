  author={Asad Khan, and Laura Madrid, and Lucas Noritomi-Hartwig},
  year={2023},
  abstract={The Indoor Rock Climbing Assistance Tool (IRCAT) aids visually impaired individuals in navigating indoor top-rope rock climbs through pose estimation and object detection. By identifying climbing routes and holds, IRCAT provides real-time audio guidance via a headset, allowing climbers to call out specific limbs and receive directions to the nearest hold for that limb. This combination of technologies makes the climbing experience more accessible for those facing visual challenges.
  Project supervised by Professor Lisa Zhang and presented at the University of Toronto's Summer Undergraduate Reserach Fair (SURF) },

  abstract={As part of our cumulative project for the Capstone Design course (CSC490), our team addressed the critical issue of brain tumors. Given the time-consuming and specialized nature of manual diagnosis, our objective was to develop automated diagnostic methods for glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Tackling the multi-class classification problem, we introduced novel approaches to improve the diagnostic process. A key focus of our project was exploring saliency maps to better understand how the model made its decisions. Our team achieved 1st place at the UTMSU's Undergraduate Research Symposium for this project.},

  abstract={For our final project in the Fundamentals of Robotics course (CSC376), my team and I crafted an environment where the Franka Emika Panda robot could engage in the festive task of decorating a Christmas tree. We successfully programmed the robot to mimic the motions required for this seasonal activity, embracing the spirit of the holiday season.},

  abstract={My team and I created two models to assist writers in crafting short bedtime stories, for our Neural Networks & Deep Learning (CSC413) Final Project: a short-story generator that continues story prompts and a title generator using a sequence-to-sequence model. These models, fine-tuned from a pre-trained GPT-2 model and trained from scratch on an RNN for title generation, aim to help writers overcome writer's block and enhance their speed in creating bedtime stories, particularly within the context of children's books.},
