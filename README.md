## Welcome to my website !
This template is based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) project.

I also found this [setup guide](https://amirpourmand.ir/posts/2022/al-folio-jekyll-website/) super helpful to run the website locally using docker by [amirpourmand](https://amirpourmand.ir/)


## License
The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
