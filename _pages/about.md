<h4 class="subtitle">Thank you for visiting my site ✨</h4>

Hi, I’m Laura Madrid, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto. I’m currently applying to graduate programs with a focus on using Computer Vision for good, particularly in areas like human-computer interaction (HCI), healthcare, and accessibility. I’m eager to join a lab where I can contribute to meaningful projects that harness technology to make a real-world impact.

My journey has been shaped by diverse industry experience, teaching, and research. I’ve worked on projects in backend, frontend, and mobile development, applying Computer Vision in healthcare, accessibility, and real estate. Notably, I contributed to a brain tumor classification model and a tool for visually impaired rock climbers. I’m also a research assistant in the Medical Computer Vision and Robotics ([MedCVR](https://medcvr.utm.utoronto.ca/)) Lab, where I'm working on endoscope pose differentiation in the larynx. These experiences have helped me grow into a well-rounded aspiring researcher with a focus on using Computer Vision for good.

Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, [drawing](/art), and hiking. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate, I’d love to hear from you. You can email me at **laura.madrid@utoronto.ca**
